This project aims to produce a model which will accurately predict the median house value of an area based on prior knowledge. A linear regression model will be used to predict these prices as a linear combination of the areaâ€™s parameters. These parameters could include, for example, crime rates or the median house size by floor area. A variety of different standard techniques, using different loss functions to quantify performance. 

The dataset used is the California Housing Data Set, based on the Californian Census in 1990. The dataset is formed of 20433 individual housing districts, each with 8 parameters describing them.

The MATLAB functions in `src` are suitable for general linear regressive tasks. Least-squares and ridge regression optimise the mean squared error (plus regularisation term in the case of ridge), and the remaining functions optimise the mean absolute error plus regularisation term. Ensure that the desired functions are added to the MATLAB path before use (in particular the errors and the shared folders are needed for all methods). Your dataset should have the true values in the final column, with the estimates made from the remaining columns of data.
