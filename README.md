This project aims to produce a model which will accurately predict the median house value of an area based on prior knowledge. A linear regression model will be used to predict these prices as a linear combination of the areaâ€™s parameters. These parameters could include, for example, crime rates or the median house size by floor area. A variety of different standard techniques, using different loss functions to quantify performance. The dataset used is the California Housing Data Set, based on the Californian Census in 1990. The dataset is formed of 20433 individual housing districts, each with 8 parameters describing them.
